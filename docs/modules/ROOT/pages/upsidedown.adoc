= Sending Messages with upsidedown.py
:screen: https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html

The Python script `bin/upsidedown.py` sends serial messages from the
command-line.

Any string received by the UART interface of the AVR is displayed.
(Assuming, you know, everything is working.) You can use whatever
serial terminal you prefer to send messages. The Linux command
{screen}[screen] and Python's pySerial {miniterm}[miniterm console]
are two other options.

.Determine your serial port
****

Although upsidedown.py tries to determine your serial port (COM port),
if you have a lot of serial devices attached to your computer it may
wrong. To list the available serial devices on your computer use the
`-l` flag.

[source, shell]
----
$ ./upsidedown.py -l
Device                                  Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------
/dev/ttyUSB0                            FT232R USB UART
----

On Linux, my serial device is `/dev/ttyUSB0`. If the default serial
port isn't working, use the `-d` flag to provide an alternative, e.g.,
`-d /dev/ttyUSB0`.

== Send a random message

Without any other command-line arguments, upsidedown.py will send a
random message like "run."

[source, shell]
----
$ ./upsidedown.py
----

== Send a custom message

To display your own message, just add it to the command-line.

[source, shell]
----
$ ./upsidedown.py stranger lights
----

== Flash the LEDs

The special message `~` can be used to flash the LEDs -- warning that
the Demogorgon is nearby.

[source, shell]
----
$ ./upsidedown.py ~
----
