= Connecting the Hardware

The hardware setup is straightforward. There is only one output pin to
the LED strip to connect from PB1 (pin 15, defined in `pins.h`).

IMPORTANT: Make sure to connect the ground wires from the LEDs and AVR
together. Otherwise the digital signal output from the AVR will be
floating, and your lights will flicker randomly.

Here is what it looks like on my breadboard.

== LED Connection

The LED strip has three wires for the data signal, ground, and 12 V.
The power rails (12 V and ground) are connected to the AC/DC power
supply. The ground wire and data wire need to be routed back to the
AVR.

== AVR Power

I used my flash programmer to power the AVR. But once you program it,
the programmer can be removed and replaced with any 5 V power supply.
