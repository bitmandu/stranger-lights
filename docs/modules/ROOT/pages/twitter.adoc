The script `bin/poll` retrieves recent tweets containing a hashtag and
displays them.

== Step 1: Prerequisites

- [*] Create a {twitter-apply}[Twitter developer account]
- [*] Install {twurl}[Twurl]

Twurl is a command-line tool (like curl) that is tailored for the
Twitter API. From your Twitter developer account, you can get a
consumer key and its secret key to make API requests with Twurl.

Setup Twurl following the {twurl-getting-started}[Getting Started]
directions.

== Step 2: Choose a Hashtag

Edit `bin/poll` with the hashtag you want to search for. I chose
`#stetr`.

[source, shell]
----
HASHTAG="stetr"
----

== Step 3: Display Tweets

[source, shell]
----
$ cd bin
$ ./poll
----

Tweets are retrieved at most every 5 seconds. If no recent tweets are
found, a random message is displayed or the lights will all flash,
indicating that the Demogorgon is nearby!
